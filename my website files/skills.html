          <p>I am obsessed with computer hardware and I have been building, configuring, and troubleshooting my own desktop computers for many years now. I have completed some online Computer Science courses, and I plan to do more over time. I have done two different IT Support certifications covering many different subjects. I have completed a course on manipulating data with Python. For example, data in CSV, JSON, XML, and HTML formats. I have completed a course on automating tasks with Python. I have completed a Cybersecurity certificate. I learned about Cybersecurity frameworks and how to use Cybersecurity tools such as network protocol analyzers, IPS/IDS software, and SIEMs. I have learned about using the Windows and Linux command lines. I have learned about using SQL and relational databases. I have learned about using Git, GitHub, and Docker.</p>
